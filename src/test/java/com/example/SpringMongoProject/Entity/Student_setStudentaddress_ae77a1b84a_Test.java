/*
Test Scenario 1: Valid Address Input
- Description: Test the function with a valid student address. The function should successfully update the student address.

Test Scenario 2: Null Address Input
- Description: Test the function with a null student address. Depending on the business logic, this could either cause an error or set the student address to null.

Test Scenario 3: Empty String Address Input
- Description: Test the function with an empty string as the student address. The function should handle this input correctly, either by setting the address to an empty string or by throwing an error.

Test Scenario 4: Address Input with Special Characters
- Description: Test the function with a student address that contains special characters. The function should handle this correctly, either by accepting the address or by throwing an error.

Test Scenario 5: Address Input with Excessive Length
- Description: Test the function with a student address that exceeds the maximum allowed length. This should either result in an error or the function should truncate the address to the maximum allowed length.

Test Scenario 6: Address Input with Numeric Characters
- Description: Test the function with a student address that contains numeric characters. Depending on your business rules, this could either be valid or invalid.

Test Scenario 7: Address Input with Non-alphanumeric characters
- Description: Test the function with a student address that contains non-alphanumeric characters. Depending on the business logic, this could either be valid or invalid.
