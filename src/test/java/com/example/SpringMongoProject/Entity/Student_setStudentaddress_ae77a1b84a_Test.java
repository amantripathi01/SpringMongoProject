 **Test Scenario 1: Valid Student Address**

**Test Objective:** To verify that the `setStudentaddress` method successfully sets a valid student address.

**Test Steps:**

1. Create a new Student object with a valid student address.
2. Call the `setStudentaddress` method on the Student object.
3. Assert that the student address of the Student object is equal to the value passed to the `setStudentaddress` method.

**Expected Result:**

The `setStudentaddress` method should successfully set the student address of the Student object to the value passed to the method.

**Test Scenario 2: Empty Student Address**

**Test Objective:** To verify that the `setStudentaddress` method throws an exception when an empty student address is passed.

**Test Steps:**

1. Create a new Student object with an empty student address.
2. Call the `setStudentaddress` method on the Student object.
3. Assert that the `setStudentaddress` method throws an exception.

**Expected Result:**

The `setStudentaddress` method should throw an exception when an empty student address is passed to the method.

**Test Scenario 3: Null Student Address**

**Test Objective:** To verify that the `setStudentaddress` method throws an exception when a null student address is passed.

**Test Steps:**

1. Create a new Student object with a null student address.
2. Call the `setStudentaddress` method on the Student object.
3. Assert that the `setStudentaddress` method throws an exception.

**Expected Result:**

The `setStudentaddress` method should throw an exception when a null student address is passed to the method.
