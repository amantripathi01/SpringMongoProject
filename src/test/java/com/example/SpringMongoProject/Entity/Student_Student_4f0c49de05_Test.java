/*
This code snippet represents a simple Student constructor in a class that is not provided. It's also annotated to be a Mongo DB document. However, as there is no business logic in the provided code snippet, it's not possible to provide specific test scenarios related to it.

However, assuming that we have a full Student class with properties such as id, name, age, and courses, here are some general test scenarios that we could consider:

1. Object Creation: Create a new Student object and validate that it has been instantiated correctly with no values.

2. ID Assignment: Test whether the ID, which is generated by MongoDB, is correctly assigned to the student object upon creation.

3. Null Value: Check if the Student object can handle null values on its properties.

4. Empty Value: Check if the Student object can handle empty values on its properties.

5. Data Persistence: Insert a Student object into the MongoDB database and then retrieve it. Validate that the retrieved object matches the original object.

6. Data Update: Update the properties of a Student object in the MongoDB database and validate that the changes are correctly saved.

7. Data Deletion: Delete a Student object from the MongoDB database and validate that it has been correctly removed.

8. Error Handling: Test how the code handles exceptions or unexpected inputs.

9. Data Type: Check if the properties of the Student object are of the correct data type.

10. Multiple Object Creation: Create multiple Student objects and validate that they are all correctly instantiated and stored in the database. 

Remember, these are general test scenarios and might need to be adjusted based on the specific business logic of your application.
