 **Test Scenario 1: Valid Student Name**

**Test Objective**: Verify that the `setStudentname` method successfully sets a valid student name.

**Test Steps**:
1. Create a new Student object.
2. Call the `setStudentname` method with a valid student name.
3. Assert that the student name is correctly set by retrieving it using the `getStudentname` method.

**Expected Result**: The student name should be successfully set and retrieved.

**Test Scenario 2: Empty Student Name**

**Test Objective**: Verify that the `setStudentname` method does not allow an empty student name.

**Test Steps**:
1. Create a new Student object.
2. Call the `setStudentname` method with an empty student name.
3. Assert that an exception is thrown, indicating that the student name cannot be empty.

**Expected Result**: An exception should be thrown, indicating that the student name cannot be empty.

**Test Scenario 3: Null Student Name**

**Test Objective**: Verify that the `setStudentname` method does not allow a null student name.

**Test Steps**:
1. Create a new Student object.
2. Call the `setStudentname` method with a null student name.
3. Assert that an exception is thrown, indicating that the student name cannot be null.

**Expected Result**: An exception should be thrown, indicating that the student name cannot be null.

**Test Scenario 4: Special Characters in Student Name**

**Test Objective**: Verify that the `setStudentname` method allows special characters in the student name.

**Test Steps**:
1. Create a new Student object.
2. Call the `setStudentname` method with a student name containing special characters.
3. Assert that the student name is correctly set and retrieved, including the special characters.

**Expected Result**: The student name should be successfully set and retrieved, including the special characters.

**Test Scenario 5: Maximum Length of Student Name**

**Test Objective**: Verify that the `setStudentname` method enforces a maximum length for the student name.

**Test Steps**:
1. Create a new Student object.
2. Call the `setStudentname` method with a student name that exceeds the maximum length.
3. Assert that an exception is thrown, indicating that the student name exceeds the maximum length.

**Expected Result**: An exception should be thrown, indicating that the student name exceeds the maximum length.

**Test Scenario 6: Trimming of Student Name**

**Test Objective**: Verify that the `setStudentname` method trims leading and trailing whitespace from the student name.

**Test Steps**:
1. Create a new Student object.
2. Call the `setStudentname` method with a student name that contains leading and trailing whitespace.
3. Assert that the student name is correctly set and retrieved, with the leading and trailing whitespace removed.

**Expected Result**: The student name should be successfully set and retrieved, with the leading and trailing whitespace removed.
